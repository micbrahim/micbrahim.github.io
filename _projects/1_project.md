"Simplicity" is a web application designed for peer-to-peer voice calling, crafted for Dubhacks 2023. The project emphasizes an intuitive and minimalistic user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and operate. It utilizes WebRTC for direct voice calling between two users, ensuring real-time communication without the need for intermediary servers. This application is compatible with modern web browsers, broadening its accessibility.

The technology stack of Simplicity includes WebRTC for real-time communication and standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development. It also utilizes a live-server for local development purposes.

Contributions to Simplicity come from Michael Ibrahim, Aruna Srivastava, and Ben Wang, as listed in the project's documentation. The project is open-source, licensed under the MIT License, ensuring wide accessibility and the possibility for further development by the community.
