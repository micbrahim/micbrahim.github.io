  title={Probing the Ethical Boundaries of Personalization: a Case Study
  of Twitter's Recommendation Algorithm},
  author={Feng, K. and Ibrahim, M. and Yoon, J.},
  abstract={Most online content platforms today are designed to maximize the
  time users spend engaging with their content. This engagement
  allows platforms to both serve advertisements and collect data from
  usage patterns to incorporate into their recommendation and per-
  sonalization algorithms. However, personalization algorithms are
  often opaque; surfacing relevant and interesting content to users
  at best, and constructing echo chambers in which users are not
  exposed to a diversity of opinions or beliefs at worst. This issue is
  exacerbated by the fact that many content platforms enable users
  to fine-tune personalization algorithms without much in the way
  of ethical guardrails, such as “liking” a post or selecting “see less/-
  more”. In this paper, we ask the question of whether there are
  ethical limits to personalization in content platforms. Twitter is a
  content platform with a wealth of publicly-available information
  surrounding its personalization algorithms, which we use as a case
  study for our investigation. We conduct a literature review of prior
  research in content personalization on social media and analyze
  published algorithmic personalization source code by Twitter along
  with related technical blog posts. We then identify ethically nu-
  anced components of Twitter's content personalization pipeline
  and analyze them from the perspective of 6 ethical theories. We con-
  clude with a discussion of how developers can more deeply engage
  with ethical considerations when building personalized systems.},
