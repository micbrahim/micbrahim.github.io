Hi! I'm a current undergraduate at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) studying computer science. I'm also a research assistant at the SSOL Lab, advised by [Vikram Iyer](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~vsiyer/)
